Welcome to this tutorial session on Computational Pathology. This hands-on session is created to showcase simple but efficient methods for classifying whole-slide-images (WSIs) of lung cancer. Although illustrated in lung cancer subtyping, similar approaches can be applied to other tasks (e.g., grading, metastasis detection), and sites (e.g., breast, prostate, etc).

This tutorial is largely based on [Lu et al., Data-efficient and weakly supervised computational pathology on whole-slide images  Nature BME 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00682-w), with code derived from [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM). 

We recommend using Google Colab for running the main notebook. All default Colab packages can be used for this session.
