        "\n",
        "Tissue phenotyping is a fundamental problem in computational pathology (CPATH) to characterize histopathologic features for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment response. Unlike natural images, whole-slide imaging is a challenging computer vision domain in which image resolutions can be as large as $150{,}000 \\times 150{,}000$ pixels (>50 GB to load the entire image in RAM).\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this computational and memory bottleneck, the majority of state-of-the-art methods use a three-stage, weakly-supervised pipeline based on multiple instance learning (MIL):\n",
        "1. Tissue patching at a single magnification objective (\"zoom\"), e.g., 20x magnification\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Patch-level feature extraction to construct a set of patch embeddings (compress patches by a factor 100~500)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Global pooling of embeddings to construct a slide-level representation for weak-supervision using slide-level labels (e.g., subtype, grade, stage, survival, origin).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notebook Objective**: The following tutorial aims to distinguish Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD, 40% of all lung cancer) vs. Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC, 30% of all lung cancer) (see [Lu et al., Data-efficient and weakly supervised computational pathology on whole-slide images  Nature BME 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00682-w) and codebase [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM). Specifically, we will:\n",
        "- Train and evaluate a \"naive\" MIL algorithm called `AverageMIL`, which takes the average of patch embeddings (as the global pooling operator).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Implement a more sophisticated algorithm called Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning (`ABMIL`), which learns attention weights for computing a weighted average of patch embeddings.\n",

        "- Compare and contrast `AverageMIL` and `ABMIL`, discussing which algorithm performs better and potential limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**About this notebook**:\n",
        "- Model implementation and training is directly adapted from [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM). CLAM includes many additional features (e.g. - letting users set up optimizers, model types, logging information, and other hyper-parameters) left out due to making this notebook as simple to run as possible for teaching purposes. To use all features, please see CLAM.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Though this notebook is based off of CLAM, the method-of-interest that you will be implementing is not CLAM, but a different method called ABMIL from [Ilse et al. Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning ICML 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04712), which CLAM is derived from.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Though pre-extracted features were generated using the CLAM codebase, the encoder was not a truncated ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet (dimension 1024) at 20 $\\times$ resolution. Instead, we extracted features with a much smaller CNN encoder (dimension 320) at 10 $\\times$ resolution, which shrinks the size of the dataset from ~11 GB to ~3.96 GB of storage (**download link for pre-extracted features in the cell below**). In addition, a torch.seed is set for reproducibility (all outputs should be deterministic)."

To alleviate this issue, this problem set provides pre-extracted features (processed via CLAM, but using a much smaller vision encoder with $D = 320$). However, to still illustrate how CLAM preprocessing works, the cell below describes a high-level overview on how WSIs are formulated as `[M x D]`-dim bag of patch embeddings, where `M` is the number of tissue patches and `D` is the hidden dimension size of your encoder. Again, please use [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) if you are interested in re-generating these features.\n",
